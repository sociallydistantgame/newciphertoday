Weeks ago, the web servers of New Cipher Today were ruined by a malicious cyber attack. Network administrators, news staff, and several volunteers were able to fully restore the website's functionality.

Law enforcement and our network administration team investigated the attack several weeks ago. The attack is believed to have originated from a foreign cybercrime group. A representative of the National Investigation Agency stated that "the recent malware attack against New Cipher Today exhibits many of the same qualities of several attacks from an at-large cybercrime group known as SpamSyndicate," and that "we are actively monitoring their whereabouts within cyberspace."

We interviewed our lead network administrator. She stated that "these kinds of attacks work by tricking individuals to open a malicious file on their computer." She went on to explain that "once executed, a malicious actor is able to control the device remotely, using it to traverse through the network." When asked for advice on how our readers can stay safe at home, she noted that "sometimes, we make mistakes. The best thing to do is to remember to make backups of your data, and to make sure you absolutely know what you're opening before you open it."

Volunteers are still working tirelessly to restore all of our previous articles. We will continue to update as this situation evolves. Please stand by.
